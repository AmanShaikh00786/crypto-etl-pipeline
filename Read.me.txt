Real-Time Crypto Prices ETL Pipeline

Project Overview
This project demonstrates a real-time ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for cryptocurrency prices. The goal is to fetch live data from the CoinGecko API, process it, store it in a database, perform aggregations, and visualize trends.  

This project highlights data engineering skills, including API ingestion, data transformation, SQL aggregation, automation, and basic analytics.



 Dataset / Data Source
- Source: CoinGecko Public API (no API key required)  
- Data: Live cryptocurrency prices (Bitcoin, Ethereum)  
- Columns after ETL:  
  - `coin` — cryptocurrency name  
  - `price_usd` — current price in USD  
  - `timestamp` — UTC time of data ingestion  
- Aggregated CSV: `daily_avg_prices.csv` with `coin`, `date`, `avg_price`



 Tools & Technologies
- Python — scripting & data processing  
- Pandas — data transformation & CSV handling  
- SQLite — lightweight data warehouse  
- Matplotlib — visualization  
- Requests — API fetching  
- Subprocess / Automation — scheduled pipeline execution



 Project Steps

# 1. Data Ingestion
- Fetch live crypto prices from the CoinGecko API using Python and Requests.  
- Transform JSON response into a structured Pandas DataFrame.

# 2. ETL Processing
- Add timestamps to each fetch.  
- Append data to `crypto_prices.csv` for historical tracking.  
- Load CSV into SQLite database for structured storage.

# 3. SQL Aggregation
- Compute daily average price per coin using SQL queries.  
- Store results in `daily_avg_prices.csv`.

# 4. Pipeline Automation
- Create `run_all.py` orchestrator to run fetch + aggregation scripts sequentially.  
- Enable scheduled execution via Task Scheduler (Windows) or cron (Linux).

# 5. Visualization
- Pivot aggregated data for coins as columns.  
- Plot daily average prices using Matplotlib to show trends over time.

 How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
######bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd crypto-etl-pipeline
######

2. Install dependencies:

######bash
pip install pandas matplotlib requests
######

3. Run the pipeline manually:

######bash
python etl/run_all.py
######

4. Optional: Schedule pipeline for automated execution (Windows Task Scheduler / Linux cron).



 Sample Output

Daily Aggregated CSV:

######
coin,date,avg_price
bitcoin,2026-01-01,43250.0
ethereum,2026-01-01,2290.0
######

Trend Visualization:

* Line chart showing daily average prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum over time.



 Resume-Ready Highlights

* Built an automated real-time ETL pipeline for cryptocurrency prices using Python and SQLite.
* Implemented JSON → DataFrame → CSV → SQLite workflow to maintain historical time-series data.
* Designed SQL aggregation layer for daily average price analysis.
* Scheduled pipeline for continuous execution, enabling production-style data ingestion.
* Visualized trends using Matplotlib for quick analytical insights.



 Future Enhancements

* Extend to more cryptocurrencies (top 10/50)
* Store data in cloud warehouse (BigQuery / AWS Redshift)
* Build a real-time dashboard (Streamlit / Dash)
* Add alert system for price thresholds
